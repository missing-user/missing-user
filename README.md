# Hi, Iâ€™m missing-user! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **computational physicist** from Munich, specialized in high-performance physics simulations, parallel computing, and optimization. 
Right now I'm finishing my master's thesis in stellarator optimization at the [Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/en) and working at [Proxima Fusion](https://www.proximafusion.com/).

## You can find most of my current projects on [jurasic.dev](https://jurasic.dev/)
